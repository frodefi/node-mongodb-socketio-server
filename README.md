node-mongodb-socketio-server
============================

Testing setting up a json-server with Node, Express (3), Socket.IO and node-mongodb-native.

This server saves notes to a database.

I also did a test for a rest-server with mysql: https://github.com/frodefi/node-mysql-json-server
and a rest-server with mongodb: https://github.com/frodefi/node-mongodb-json-server

Please feel free to use this code as you like :)

I have learned and adapted code from (among others) the following tutorials while setting this up:
http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb
http://www.joezimjs.com/javascript/plugging-into-socket-io-the-basics/
http://www.joezimjs.com/javascript/plugging-into-socket-io-advanced/
http://codehenge.net/blog/2012/08/using-socket-io-with-express-3-x/
And of course all the docs from the developers of the modules mentioned on the top, for example:
http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/getting-started/
http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/driver-articles/mongoclient.html
