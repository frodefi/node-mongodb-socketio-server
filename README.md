node-mongodb-socketio-server
============================

Testing setting up a json-server with Node, Restify Socket.IO and node-mongodb-native.
I will also include authentication using Passport.

Restify can very easily be replaced with Express, probably just by changing the require-module to use Express.
See here the reason why you might want to use Restify: http://mcavage.github.com/node-restify/

This server saves notes to a database.

I also did a test for a rest-server with mysql: https://github.com/frodefi/node-mysql-json-server
and a rest-server with mongodb: https://github.com/frodefi/node-mongodb-json-server

Please feel free to use this code as you like :)
